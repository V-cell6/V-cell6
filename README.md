About Me
-👋 Hey there, curious mind! I'm on a mission to unravel the intricacies of Agentic AI, LLMs, MLOps, basically all things Data Science. 
-🔍 Currently, I'm diving deep into the inner workings of transformers—because understanding their magic is half the fun! If you’re as fascinated by AI as I am, let’s build something extraordinary together.

-✍️ Oh, and fun fact: I moonlight as a writer! I pen down my thoughts on AI and Data Science over at [Medium](https://medium.com/@vedant6). Feel free to give it a read, a follow, and leave down your thoughts!
